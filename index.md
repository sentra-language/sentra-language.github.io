## Why Sentra?

Sentra eliminates the complexity of building security tools by providing networking and security capabilities directly in the language. No external libraries, no complicated setup—just write code and run it.

### Network Security Made Simple

```sentra
// Port scanner in 6 lines
let target = "192.168.1.1"
let results = port_scan(target, 1, 1000, "TCP")

for (let port in results) {
    if (port["state"] == "open") {
        log("Open: " + str(port["port"]) + " (" + port["service"] + ")")
    }
}
```

### HTTP APIs Without Frameworks

```sentra
// Complete web API server
let server = http_server_create("127.0.0.1", 8080)

http_server_route(server["id"], "GET", "/scan", fn(req) {
    let results = port_scan("127.0.0.1", 1, 100, "TCP") 
    return http_response(200, "{\"open_ports\": 5}", {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    })
})

http_server_start(server["id"])
log("Security API running at http://127.0.0.1:8080")
```
