## Why Sentra?

Sentra eliminates the complexity of building security tools by providing networking and security capabilities directly in the language. No external libraries, no complicated setupâ€”just write code and run it.

### Network Security Made Simple

```javascript
// Port scanner in 6 lines
let target = "192.168.1.1"
let results = port_scan(target, 1, 1000, "TCP")

for (let port in results) {
    if (port["state"] == "open") {
        log("Open: " + str(port["port"]) + " (" + port["service"] + ")")
    }
}
```

### HTTP APIs Without Frameworks

```javascript
// Complete web API server
let server = http_server_create("127.0.0.1", 8080)

http_server_route(server["id"], "GET", "/scan", fn(req) {
    let results = port_scan("127.0.0.1", 1, 100, "TCP") 
    return http_response(200, "{\"open_ports\": 5}", {
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    })
})

http_server_start(server["id"])
log("Security API running at http://127.0.0.1:8080")
```
